  Growing up I was big into baseball. I loved playing since the age of 6. 
  <strong>Playing this game</strong> helped me to gain an interest in sports and 
  more specifically physical therapy.

  I am currently majoring in Data Analytics within the iSchool at Syracuse.
  I would love to take my passion of sports medicine and apply my 
  extensively needed major to an aspect of this field.
